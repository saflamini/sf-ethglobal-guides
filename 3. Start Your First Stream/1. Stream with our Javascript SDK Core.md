Target audience: mildly-experienced Web3 developer with some Solidity and/or javascript experience
Goal: Get from Point A (doesn't know how to write code that streams money) to Point B (does know how to stream)

## **Creating Your First Stream with the SDK Core**

Creating streams with the SDK core is dead simple - you just need to pass in the `receiver`, `superToken`, and `flowRate`.

- Note: you may also pass in an optional bytes value called `userData`, but that’s advanced class stuff. [Read more about it in our docs.](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/developers/developer-guides/super-apps/user-data)

```
sf.cfaV1.createFlow({
	receiver: “0x123…”,
	superToken: daix.address,
	flowRate: “385802469135802” //equivalent to 1000 dai per month
});
```

Expand the editor (by dragging the menu open from left to right) in the code sandbox example below to see a full initialization & implementation of stream creation in a simple react application.
